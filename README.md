💻 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Projects

A collection of Python projects demonstrating the principles of Object-Oriented Programming through practical, real-world systems.

🧩 Overview

This repository contains three mini-projects built using Python and OOP concepts.
Each notebook is designed to help learners and developers understand how abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism can be applied to build structured and scalable software systems.

🧠 Projects Included
1. 🧾 Employee Management System

Simulates a basic HR system using classes and objects.
Key Features:

Add, update, and remove employee records

Demonstrates class attributes and instance methods

Illustrates inheritance for different employee roles

Concepts Used:
Class, Object, Constructor, Encapsulation, Method Overriding

2. 🏥 Hospital Management System

A simplified hospital database simulation demonstrating OOP design.
Key Features:

Manage patient and doctor records

Link patients with assigned doctors

Calculate medical bills and room charges

Concepts Used:
Composition, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism

3. 📚 Library Management System

A mini project for managing books and users using OOP structures.
Key Features:

Add, issue, and return books

Maintain borrower details and availability status

Demonstrates object relationships and data encapsulation

Concepts Used:
Class Relationships, Abstraction, Private Attributes, File Handling

🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: Python 3.x

Tools: Jupyter Notebook

Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming

🎯 Learning Outcomes

Understand how to design systems using OOP

Learn to structure programs with real-world use cases

Strengthen Python programming fundamentals

Gain practical coding experience for software development internships

⚙️ How to Run

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/asfandyar-prog/Object-Oriented-Programming.git
cd Object-Oriented-Programming


Open the notebook you want to explore:

jupyter notebook Employee_sys.ipynb


Run the cells sequentially to see the OOP logic in action.

📈 Future Enhancements

Add database (SQLite or MySQL) integration

Build GUI versions using Tkinter or PyQt

Convert notebooks into Python scripts with CLI support
